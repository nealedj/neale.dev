This page represents the landing page for "projects" section. It is also shown under the homepage header for "projects". It should be therefore relatively short and sweet.

IN the dfault theme, "projects" is divided among "Creations" you authored and "contributions" made to others projects.

-->
<p>A collection of projects <a href="/projects/creations">I've created</a> and <a href="/projects/contributions">contributed to</a>. Everything listed is open source; the distinction is simply my role as owner or contributor.</p>
