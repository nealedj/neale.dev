## TMG Training Mnemonics

To support powered motorglider training, I've created a series of posters that help pilots remember essential checklists and procedures. These visual aids distil complex procedures into memorable formats, perfect for study and quick reference.

### Poster 1: FREDA checks

Checks performed every 15-30 mins whilst in flight

### Poster 2: OBUMPFITCHH Pre-landing checks

Checks performed during downwind leg. There are many variations of these checks. These are the ones I use in a Grob 109.

### Poster 3: FMOST Engine Failure
