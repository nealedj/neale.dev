A delivery-oriented technical strategist helping teams ship resilient software.

Extensive experience across software engineering, AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, and cybersecurity—focused on pragmatic architecture, operability, and outcomes.

Currently Chief Architect at Admiral Money. I work best where reliability, security, and delivery speed all matter—and trade-offs need to be made explicit. I partner with product and engineering leaders to turn strategy into executable roadmaps and measurable delivery.
